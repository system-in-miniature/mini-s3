# Stage 12 · Multipart crash recovery

### Goal

Prove both sides of a completion crash: keep retryable staging before publish, clean it after publish.

### Hands-on task

Starting from stage-11, Exercise `_recover_uploads(...)` with crashes before and after manifest publication. Keep all behavior inside the listed source-like boundaries; do not copy the patch first.

### Deliverable files / 交付文件

- `tests/test_storage.py`

### Self-check

1. Where is this stage's visibility or state transition owned?

    ??? note "Answer"
        Recovery correlates a published object with its upload ID to make cleanup idempotent.

2. Which test would fail first if the new boundary were bypassed?

    ??? note "Answer"
        Read `tests.txt`, identify the narrowest new node, and name the public call it exercises.

### Pass command

`uv run pytest -q $(cat journey/stages/12-multipart-recovery/tests.txt)`

### The real S3 lesson

Recovery correlates a published object with its upload ID to make cleanup idempotent.
